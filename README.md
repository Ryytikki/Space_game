Space Game
=========

Just another possible game idea based on semi-accurate orbital mechanics

Using a sphere of influence system to simplify the force calculations. May alter this so the SoIs are only in effect for large bodies like stars but planets etc are standard F= GmM/r**2

control the ship by clicking in the direction you want to go. Still in early concept testing so theres not really much to look at 

Requires Pygame
